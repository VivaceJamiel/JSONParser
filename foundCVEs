    "CVE-2017-7725": "concrete5 8.1.0 places incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header during caching, if the administrator did not define a \"canonical\" URL on installation of concrete5 using the \"Advanced Options\" settings. Remote attackers can make a GET request with any domain name in the Host header; this is stored and allows for arbitrary domains to be set for certain links displayed to subsequent visitors, potentially an XSS vector.",
    "CVE-2015-1494": "The FancyBox for WordPress plugin before 3.0.3 for WordPress does not properly restrict access, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an mfbfw[*] parameter in an update action to wp-admin/admin-post.php, as demonstrated by the mfbfw[padding] parameter and exploited in the wild in February 2015.",
